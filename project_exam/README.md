# PROJECT: DEPLOY A LAMP STACK APPLICATION

## OBJECTIVES

* Automate the provisioning of two Ubuntu-based servers, named “Master” and “Slave”, using Vagrant.
* On the Master node, create a bash script to automate the deployment of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.
* This script should clone a PHP application from GitHub, install all necessary packages, and configure Apache web server and MySQL
* Ensure the bash script is reusable and readable.
* Using an Ansible playbook:
    1. Execute the bash script on the Slave node and verify that the PHP application is accessible through the VM’s IP address (take screenshot of this as evidence)
    2. Create a cron job to check the server’s uptime every 12am
